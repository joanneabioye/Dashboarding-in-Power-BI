# Dashboarding in Power BI
I undertook a project using Power BI to craft a dashboard for Adventure Works, aimed at presenting insights on customer types, trends, and forecasts. The project requirements included showcasing individual product performance over time on a monthly basis, forecasting profit for the upcoming 6 weeks, and visualising customer types with a focus on identifying customers with the highest number of orders.

To fulfil these requirements, I commenced by establishing relationships between various workbooks. Once this foundation was laid, I strategized the data necessary to meet the objectives and determined the most suitable visualisations to effectively communicate the findings. I used a range of visuals, including column charts, funnels, cards, line charts, and stacked charts.
For instance, to create an average age card, I adjusted the settings in the dropdown menu from Count to Average, setting the number of decimal places to zero.

For forecasting, I utilised Order Quantity and Order Date from the AdventureWorks_Sales_2017 dataset, activating the forecasting option and configuring parameters such as Forecast Length and Seasonality to forecast sales for the subsequent 6 weeks.

To ensure coherence and brand alignment, I opted for a colour scheme that resonated with the Adventure Works logo, initially adjusting the theme in the View tab and matching the default colour of chart titles accordingly.

Upon completing the dashboard, I found it effective in telling a story while maintaining visual appeal. One challenge encountered was transforming the Sales by Product Key to a monthly format rather than daily. However, with continued practice and familiarity with Power BI, I anticipate mastering such adjustments effortlessly. Additionally, in retrospect, I would opt to utilise product names instead of product keys in the stacked area chart for enhanced clarity.
